### Review what we learned

- **Repositories:** A repository is where you store your project's code. It can be public or private.
- **Branches:** Branches are versions of your repository. You can create branches to work on new features or fixes.
- **Commits:** Commits are saved changes. Each commit has an associated commit message.
- **Pull requests:** Pull requests propose changes to your repository. Other contributors can review and discuss the proposed changes.

- You created a branch, a commit, and a pull request.
- You merged a pull request.
- You made your first contribution! :tada:

### What's next?

a student need study more english you now this time i still not read this website very well [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.

1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
5. Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/skills/discussions/categories/introduction-to-github).
